 "There is a place of peace \n There is a place of joy \n A place away from loneliness \n A place away from pain \n That place is next to you \n A secret garden \n Where black and white becomes a colorful place \n Of loving, kisses, touching, caressing, \n There with you and only you \n Cares of the world melting away \n Anger and fear are not allowed \n Prejudice cannot enter \n A place where two hearts beat as one \n A place where two souls are interwoven, \n Touching the inner-place of one another \n A place that I long to come back to again and again \n A place of sweet abandon \n A place next to you \n — Rocky Stonehedge",
      

"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. /n I love thee to the depth and breadth and height /n My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight /n For the ends of being and ideal grace. /n I love thee to the level of every day’s /n Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. /n I love thee freely, as men strive for right. /n I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. /n I love thee with the passion put to use /n In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith. /n I love thee with a love I seemed to lose /n With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, /n Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, /n I shall but love thee better after death. /n —Elizabeth Barrett Browning",

 

"Happy Birthday, dear friend! Being the good friend that I am, I won’t let you celebrate your big day alone. And I definitely won’t let you eat your birthday cake alone! Best wishes!"
